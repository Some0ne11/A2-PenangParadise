                <p>
                Penang Floating Mosque is just like any other typical mosque but for the 
                uniqueness that it is built in the ocean water, making it stand out from the 
                others. Built not so long ago in 2005, this is the only one that is built in the ocean water.

                <p>
                This 1821 colonial building is like entering into the doors of the ancient times 
                because every corner right from the gate onwards narrates the history of Penang. 
                Holding a significant place in the Penang tourist places, this museum is a treasure 
                of galleries, artefacts, creativity, and costumes which express the events from the 
                past in a manner that one can easily relate to.

                <p>
                Penang Wonderfood Museum is true to its name, a â€˜food museumâ€™ that is one-of-a-kind 
                and explicitly marvellous. This building is dedicated to glorifying the food culture 
                of Penang by creating large plastic models of the food that this place is known for.

                <p>
                The Dhammikarna Burmese Temple is the only Burmese Buddha temple outside Myanmar 
                and has statues of his meditation pose at every end of this temple. The eccentric 
                story of Buddha is conveyed through the frescoes that you will witness as you walk 
                inside this serene atmosphere where there is also a Bodhi Tree and a wishing pond.

                Penang 3D Trick Art Museum is for all those who love to click pictures until the phoneâ€™s battery dies; 
                here you can do just that, but by tricking the viewer. 
                The museum has been designed in a manner where one can click pictures with several structures 
                that may seem ordinary, but have a catch to make things original when you see them in an image.
